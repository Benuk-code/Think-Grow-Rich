        This new eBook version of “Think and Grow Rich” by Napoleon Hill has
        been made available because we truly believe that this text contains ideas and
        concepts that have the power to transform people's lives. We sincerely hope that
        this text helps you to begin YOUR journey to discovering the Riches in your life.<br>
        We have taken great effort to ensure that this text is as close to the original
        version as possible. Bringing you this free version of the eBook took several
        weeks of preparation. A great deal of time was spent sourcing the content from
        
        numerous sources available in the Public Domain; checking, proofing and re-
        checking the material to have the correct italics (ensuring proper emphasis of the
        
        text is conveyed); creating graphics we hope you find visually appealing as well
        as preparing a website dedicated to the free distribution of the ideas contained in
        this book.
